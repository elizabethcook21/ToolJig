## Notes

The first example here is to download FASTQ files from the Sequence Read Archive. This process takes many hours and uses hundreds of gigabytes of disk space. Because of the large sizes of these files, we do not include the data files in this repository. Furthermore, the second step is to create smaller versions of the FASTQ files to make it easier to run the example tools. But you cannot really trust the variant calls because they were made using only a subset of the data.
